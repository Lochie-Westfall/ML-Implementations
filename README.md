# ML Implementations

This repository is a showcase of some machine learning algorithms I have implemented. Alongside the implementations, I will be writing supporting blogs explaining the algorithm and my development process.

While I am working on this project, another priority is developing my mathematical understanding. At the current point in time, I am not able to construct mathematical proofs and describe the fundamental concepts with all the correct terminology. But I am putting a lot of effort into making sure that I soon will. As I continue to learn, I will incorporate more mathematics and implement progressively more complex algorithms.

In the meantime, if you find any errors or have any suggestions for new algorithms, make sure to contact me at "lochiewestfall@gmail.com". On the other side of the coin, if you are a beginner and found something difficult to understand, let me know and I will try to revise it. Not only will it help me with my learning but will also make the article more valuable for other readers who are trying to learn.
