# ML Implementations

This repository is a showcase of some machine learning algorithms I have implemented. If you find any errors or have any suggestions for new algorithms, make sure to contact me at "lochiewestfall@gmail.com". On the other side of the coin, if you are a beginner and found something difficult to understand, let me know and I will try to revise it. Not only will it help me with my learning but will also make the article more valuable for other readers who are trying to learn.
